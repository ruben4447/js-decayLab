# TODO

- Script to check existance of each decay isotope [DONE]
  - Decay for metastable isotopes "m" e.g. "In-119m" does not exist, but "In-119m1" and "In-119m2" do
  - If multiple isotopic isomers exist, select random [DONE]

- Halflife estimator of current sample

- Finish estimating stability of any isotope

- Spontaneous Fission: select suitable nucleau to emit
  - Most decay failiures are due to no "daughter isotope present" when the decay mode is SF
  - Create function to get a suitable suggestion and emit this
