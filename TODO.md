- Render Options (make these options) [DONE]
    - Sample with atoms (default) [DONE]
    - Overview piechart (Chart.js) [DONE]

- Script to check existance of each decay isotope
    - Decay for metastable isotopes "m" e.g. "In-119m" does not exist, but "In-119m1" and "In-119m2" do
    - If multiple isotopic isomers exist, select random

- "Main" isotope of atoms to highlight

- Halflife estimator of current sample
