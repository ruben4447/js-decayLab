# TODO

- Script to check existance of each decay isotope [DONE, no action taken]
  - Decay for metastable isotopes "m" e.g. "In-119m" does not exist, but "In-119m1" and "In-119m2" do
  - If multiple isotopic isomers exist, select random

- Halflife estimator of current sample

- Finish estimating stability of any isotope
