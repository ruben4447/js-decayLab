# TODO

- Render Options (make these options) [DONE]

  - Sample with atoms (default) [DONE]
  - Overview piechart (Chart.js) [DONE]
- Script to check existance of each decay isotope

  - Decay for metastable isotopes "m" e.g. "In-119m" does not exist, but "In-119m1" and "In-119m2" do
  - If multiple isotopic isomers exist, select random
- Click event handler for all legend items [DONE]

  - "Stable" and "radioactive" : list isotopes [DONE]
  - "Decayed", "Not Decayed" and decayed no. : list isotopes [DONE]
- "Main" isotope of atoms to highlight [IN PROGRESS]

  - See test/
- Halflife estimator of current sample
- Manual Override
  - Finish estimating stability
