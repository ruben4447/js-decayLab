# TODO

- Script to check existance of each decay isotope [DONE, no action taken]
  - Decay for metastable isotopes "m" e.g. "In-119m" does not exist, but "In-119m1" and "In-119m2" do
  - If multiple isotopic isomers exist, select random

- "Main" isotope or atoms to highlight
  - Input "main" atom/isotope

- Halflife estimator of current sample

- Manual Override [IN PROGRESS]
  - Force decay [DONE]
  - Insert custom isotope (both by string and by number)
  - Edit proton/neutron count [DONE]

- Finish estimating stability of any isotope
